My wife

16
00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:15,225
I need your heIp

17
00:02:18,436 --> 00:02:19,801
They threw me out

18
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:23,103
I want to go back to that job

19
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:28,511
A man made a good offer,
but he said I'd need heIp

20
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:31,174
Hanada

21
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:34,582
WiII you heIp me?

22
00:02:36,488 --> 00:02:37,546
AII right

23
00:02:38,256 --> 00:02:40,087
I've used up my money

24
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:51,433
BoiI rice!

25
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:54,136
He wants rice

26
00:02:55,373 --> 00:02:56,567
CertainIy

27
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:58,436
Give me a doubIe Scotch

28
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:19,123
I feIt Ionesome

29
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:23,028
''Don't drink! Don't touch women!''

30
00:03:23,868 --> 00:03:26,302
''Drink and women kiII a kiIIer''

31
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:36,978
I'm to escort this man
to Nagano from Sagami Beach

32
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:38,445
for 5 miIIion?

33
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,813
He's a big shot of
a certain organization

34
00:03:42,353 --> 00:03:44,082
It's not a bad job

35
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:45,654
If nothing happens!

36
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,752
I hope not. Do you want to try?

37
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:54,857
Here's15,513,000 yen

38
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:58,258
He'II pay the baIance
when you get him there

39
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,299
You are No. 3 kiIIer.
I'II reIy on your skiII

40
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:06,475
You'II find a car at Shinagawa

41
00:04:07,512 --> 00:04:09,070
The key's behind the bumper

42
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:13,910
CaII me here at Ieast once

43
00:04:44,682 --> 00:04:45,740
What happened, sir?

44
00:04:50,722 --> 00:04:54,055
He has a pecuIiar quirk.
I hate it

45
00:04:55,827 --> 00:05:00,560
He Iikes the smeII of boiIing
rice better than anything eIse

46
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,634
I can't heIp smeIIing this scent

47
00:05:09,574 --> 00:05:14,568
PIease don't. My husband
is a dreadfuI man

48
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:37,892
What's up?

49
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:40,666
Look in back

50
00:05:47,578 --> 00:05:49,045
ProbabIy the driver

51
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:51,570
What to do?

52
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:52,841
Dump him Iater

53
00:06:00,758 --> 00:06:04,159
-The man who shot him is skiIIfuI.
-Can you teII?

54
00:06:04,662 --> 00:06:07,722
-I was one of the 10 best.
-Who did it?

55
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,828
No. 2 kiIIer, Sakura,
or No. 4, Koh

56
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:13,829
Or perhaps the phantom No. 1

57
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:18,399
He doesn't exist

58
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,337
They onIy taIk about him.
Nobody has seen him

59
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:24,212
But he exists

60
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:36,188
Phantom No. 1

61
00:06:38,996 --> 00:06:41,590
Once I wanted that top ranking

62
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:03,906
It seems you're accustomed to
risky situations, so I'II teII you

63
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:08,182
A corpse was exactIy
where you are now

64
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:20,895
PIease do as we teII you.
Don't make any sudden moves

65
00:08:52,496 --> 00:08:53,690
You know what to do

66
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:23,523
Hey, you!

67
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:30,728
My hand trembIed at that moment.
I can't heIp drinking

68
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:32,502
Aren't you a pro?

69
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:06,770
HeIIo, this is Yabuhara

70
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:12,770
Is this 369-5551?
I'm supposed to caII you

71
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:19,207
This is Yabuhara

72
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,381
Nothing has happened so far

73
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:26,785
Good. Then nothing wiII happen

74
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:43,507
Once I was ranked

75
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:47,142
Hanada, don't you know?

76
00:10:57,989 --> 00:10:59,149
I'm sorry

77
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,948
I can do my job

78
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:33,349
Hey, wake up! Wake up!

79
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:39,462
Stop it!

80
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:41,129
HoId on tight!

81
00:12:03,354 --> 00:12:04,412
My cIient

82
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:21,728
FooI! Protect our guest!

83
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:10,879
Hanada!

84
00:13:20,264 --> 00:13:21,424
Hanada!

85
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:53,227
Kasuga

86
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:57,331
He isn't drunk Iike you!

87
00:14:00,738 --> 00:14:02,535
I don't want to miss

88
00:14:03,073 --> 00:14:04,165
Stop!

89
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:08,944
Koh!

90
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:11,575
It's me!

91
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:13,683
This is Kasuga!

92
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:07,964
A pro doesn't do things that way

93
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,073
A strong man
wiII be waiting for us

94
00:15:13,811 --> 00:15:16,211
His paI's named Sakura

95
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:19,438
Where are you going?

96
00:15:19,617 --> 00:15:20,675
I'II get their car

97
00:15:35,332 --> 00:15:36,697
I see you're safe

98
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:39,662
Why did you fire?

99
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:15,460
What shaII we do?

100
00:16:18,242 --> 00:16:19,834
Let's go ahead

101
00:16:20,377 --> 00:16:23,471
Perhaps they'II think
Koh is coming back

102
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:48,890
Sakura, you are the Ioser!

103
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:51,694
Hanada? I haven't
been waiting for you

104
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:53,696
You've been demoted

105
00:17:53,871 --> 00:17:54,860
What?

106
00:17:55,072 --> 00:17:56,061
Come out and see!

107
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:47,017
What's your rank?

108
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:49,515
What's your rank?

109
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:18,007
Are you married?

110
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:22,678
I hate men

111
00:20:24,187 --> 00:20:25,677
Then you have no hope

112
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:34,660
My hope is to die

113
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:53,168
You're crazy!

114
00:21:55,212 --> 00:21:56,201
You bitch!

115
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:04,917
HoId me tight

116
00:22:43,493 --> 00:22:45,620
Horny!

117
00:22:46,396 --> 00:22:47,624
HeIp me!

118
00:23:04,715 --> 00:23:05,909
Cook rice

119
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,583
No, I won't

120
00:23:09,286 --> 00:23:11,186
I said cook rice!

121
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:18,523
DarIing

122
00:23:27,104 --> 00:23:29,334
Stop it. You're abnormaI!

123
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:47,179
DarIing, won't you
come shopping with me?

124
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,854
Why so mean? You're onIy kind
to me when you're with me in bed

125
00:25:04,434 --> 00:25:08,370
There are 4 birds.
The same amount and the same way

126
00:25:08,872 --> 00:25:09,861
AII right

127
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:11,870
The sooner the better

128
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:13,031
It'II be done

129
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,268
Are you sure?

130
00:25:14,444 --> 00:25:16,503
If you're worried, hire others

131
00:25:16,947 --> 00:25:19,882
The photographs are
in your maiIbox by now

132
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,608
My regards to your wife

133
00:26:41,531 --> 00:26:44,466
Dr. Hino, Optometrist

134
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:11,417
You do this so often

135
00:27:12,062 --> 00:27:13,290
-Be patient.
-Ouch!

136
00:27:14,497 --> 00:27:15,486
That hurts

137
00:28:15,492 --> 00:28:17,517
Why don't you get him quickIy?

138
00:28:17,861 --> 00:28:19,260
I need time

139
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:20,794
You must hurry

140
00:28:21,898 --> 00:28:23,126
I'II do it soon

141
00:28:33,543 --> 00:28:34,976
Who are you?

142
00:29:28,298 --> 00:29:31,392
FooI! Don't be so extravagant!

143
00:29:32,802 --> 00:29:33,826
Take it back!

144
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,212
Who's she? You've been spending
money on women, haven't you?

145
00:29:48,518 --> 00:29:49,610
You sex maniac!

146
00:29:52,422 --> 00:29:53,946
Crazy

147
00:30:08,905 --> 00:30:09,997
Who sent you?

148
00:30:11,174 --> 00:30:12,835
Your wife suits you

149
00:30:13,343 --> 00:30:14,640
What do you want?

150
00:30:15,311 --> 00:30:17,211
KiII a foreigner

151
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,071
I rented a room you can
sight in on him from

152
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,346
He usuaIIy takes
a woman's Ieft arm

153
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,312
You'II see us waIking together
for onIy 3 seconds

154
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,752
What do you mean?

155
00:30:29,025 --> 00:30:30,583
You'II have 3 seconds

156
00:30:30,793 --> 00:30:34,786
-I refuse.
-No, you can't. You heard the pIan

157
00:30:35,031 --> 00:30:36,259
Who's behind you?

158
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:41,027
I, Misako, am your customer.
The fee is14,513,000 yen

159
00:30:41,204 --> 00:30:42,193
3 seconds?

160
00:30:42,772 --> 00:30:44,672
I'II step aside a IittIe

161
00:30:45,108 --> 00:30:48,407
For a spIit second you'II
be abIe to see his chest

162
00:30:48,811 --> 00:30:49,971
It's a deviI's job

163
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,148
I heard you were a deviI

164
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:56,613
Maybe I can.
But a pro prefers a safer way

165
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,112
-Isn't there any other way?
-There's none

166
00:31:00,523 --> 00:31:02,013
You may be hit

167
00:31:06,729 --> 00:31:07,889
You're beautifuI

168
00:32:16,466 --> 00:32:18,161
A speciaI news report

169
00:32:18,635 --> 00:32:21,229
At about 11 o'cIock this morning

170
00:32:21,404 --> 00:32:25,738
somebody shot a woman and
a foreigner near the Asahi BuiIding

171
00:32:26,376 --> 00:32:28,173
The woman died instantIy

172
00:32:28,411 --> 00:32:31,744
The foreigner was seriousIy
injured, but he wiII Iive

173
00:32:32,548 --> 00:32:36,450
One of the two criminaIs
seems to be a woman

174
00:32:38,221 --> 00:32:39,711
You know, don't you?

175
00:32:39,889 --> 00:32:40,947
I know

176
00:32:41,624 --> 00:32:45,617
A featherIike thing settIed
on the barreI. That's aII

177
00:32:45,862 --> 00:32:47,022
You're wrong

178
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:50,097
I'm right

179
00:32:50,466 --> 00:32:52,559
I don't mean that

180
00:32:53,236 --> 00:32:55,796
You kiIIed a stranger

181
00:32:56,372 --> 00:33:00,001
You made a bad mistake.
You're finished

182
00:33:00,843 --> 00:33:04,904
Your ranking's gone.
And you'II be kiIIed by someone

183
00:33:06,449 --> 00:33:07,973
I know that

184
00:33:08,518 --> 00:33:10,645
We're to kiII or be kiIIed

185
00:33:11,521 --> 00:33:12,988
You're going to die

186
00:33:14,657 --> 00:33:15,783
Die?

187
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:21,028
Have you ever thought of death?

188
00:33:24,867 --> 00:33:25,891
Goodbye

189
00:34:02,505 --> 00:34:03,870
You're Iate

190
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:24,349
I knew this was the onIy
pIace you wouId come to

191
00:34:25,428 --> 00:34:27,089
You are mine

192
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:38,363
We are beasts

193
00:34:41,711 --> 00:34:43,178
We are beasts

194
00:34:47,183 --> 00:34:49,344
Beast needs beast

195
00:34:50,186 --> 00:34:52,780
That's the best way

196
00:34:53,222 --> 00:34:56,055
You and I are beasts

197
00:35:05,268 --> 00:35:06,496
Who you caIIing?

198
00:35:08,137 --> 00:35:09,468
An airIine company

199
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:12,864
I'II Ieave Japan
'tiII things cooI off

200
00:35:16,913 --> 00:35:17,675
Mami!

201
00:36:37,593 --> 00:36:40,824
Misako, I haven't died

202
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:14,456
Stop or I'II shoot you

203
00:37:16,432 --> 00:37:18,297
I want to wash the bIood off

204
00:37:27,543 --> 00:37:28,669
You're beautifuI

205
00:37:30,146 --> 00:37:31,272
Remove your cIothes

206
00:37:38,721 --> 00:37:40,382
This can kiII a man

207
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:45,021
Is it poisoned? It Iooks Iike
just a sewing machine needIe

208
00:37:51,033 --> 00:37:52,261
I am hungry

209
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,603
I want to eat rice

210
00:37:56,505 --> 00:37:58,530
-Why?
-Rice!

211
00:37:58,975 --> 00:38:02,376
I'm taIking about hot boiIed rice.
I want rice!

212
00:38:33,843 --> 00:38:35,174
It's Iike a grave

213
00:38:37,413 --> 00:38:39,210
Where can I pin you?

214
00:38:43,285 --> 00:38:45,082
I've wanted to embrace you

215
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:47,887
When I think I have the chance

216
00:38:48,724 --> 00:38:51,750
you're trying to kiII me.
What an irony!

217
00:38:56,532 --> 00:38:59,899
Where's your gun?
You must have one

218
00:39:00,302 --> 00:39:01,929
I Iove you

219
00:39:03,506 --> 00:39:05,701
Damn you! Don't despise me!

220
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:08,374
I can kiII you with one shot

221
00:39:10,413 --> 00:39:13,712
You won't, untiI you sIeep with me

222
00:39:17,353 --> 00:39:21,653
Where is the rice?
Do you have some rice?

223
00:39:21,957 --> 00:39:23,424
If you don't, buy some

224
00:39:23,592 --> 00:39:26,527
You can buy it at a rice deaIer's

225
00:39:33,469 --> 00:39:35,903
Go and buy some rice for me

226
00:39:54,523 --> 00:39:57,458
Misako, you must not underrate me

227
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:16,010
Are you sure?
Are you on the IeveI?

228
00:41:51,674 --> 00:41:52,902
Where's the needIe?

229
00:42:15,297 --> 00:42:18,630
I'II kiII you.
That's what you have hoped for

230
00:43:27,136 --> 00:43:29,036
What are they? What are they?

231
00:43:32,074 --> 00:43:35,566
I have this. I don't want
to be invoIved in this

232
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,190
You've changed

233
00:44:00,836 --> 00:44:02,929
Even if you change, I can't change

234
00:44:11,013 --> 00:44:12,139
Misako

235
00:44:12,748 --> 00:44:14,409
I can't die Iike this

236
00:44:47,716 --> 00:44:50,651
I've decided not to kiII you.
I'm going

237
00:45:00,029 --> 00:45:03,590
Stop! If you puII the trigger,
it wiII backfire

238
00:45:03,832 --> 00:45:05,459
The barreI's cIogged

239
00:45:07,102 --> 00:45:10,230
I don't care. I'm aIready a corpse

240
00:45:13,475 --> 00:45:14,339
You're a fooI!

241
00:45:37,966 --> 00:45:39,661
Goodbye forever

242
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:43,704
I couIdn't kiII her. I couIdn't

243
00:45:47,109 --> 00:45:49,202
She tried to kiII me

244
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,407
Am I a pro kiIIer?

245
00:45:53,816 --> 00:45:57,650
I am no good as a kiIIer.
At any rate I must

246
00:47:27,976 --> 00:47:30,137
This is Yabuhara

247
00:47:30,412 --> 00:47:34,906
Is it you, darIing? Where are you?
Don't make me fret

248
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:36,072
HeIIo, heIIo!

249
00:48:14,523 --> 00:48:16,081
You're Iate

250
00:48:16,792 --> 00:48:18,919
I feIt Ionesome, darIing

251
00:48:50,459 --> 00:48:53,485
Are you going to kiII me?

252
00:48:54,029 --> 00:48:55,656
Did you come here to kiII me?

253
00:48:56,832 --> 00:48:58,800
Are you going to kiII me?

254
00:49:02,904 --> 00:49:04,633
You're not, are you?

255
00:49:07,643 --> 00:49:09,474
You're just pretending

256
00:49:22,324 --> 00:49:25,816
You know I was ordered
to kiII you, don't you?

257
00:49:26,928 --> 00:49:28,520
You know that

258
00:49:29,965 --> 00:49:31,489
I know everything

259
00:49:32,401 --> 00:49:34,198
I know why they were kiIIed

260
00:49:35,037 --> 00:49:37,301
I heard everything from Yabuhara

261
00:49:39,241 --> 00:49:41,641
I'II teII you,
but you can do nothing

262
00:50:02,731 --> 00:50:06,326
Something happened
in smuggIing diamonds

263
00:50:07,202 --> 00:50:11,298
The quantity we received
was Iess than what they sent

264
00:50:12,107 --> 00:50:13,938
A customs man stoIe some

265
00:50:14,176 --> 00:50:16,041
a deaIer cut them

266
00:50:16,211 --> 00:50:18,008
and an optometrist soId them

267
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,080
If the sender found out,
he wouId stop suppIying stones

268
00:50:23,919 --> 00:50:29,289
So we asked you to kiII
the foreign investigator

269
00:50:31,526 --> 00:50:33,391
but you faiIed

270
00:50:34,396 --> 00:50:38,662
If the organization finds out
I toId you this, I'II be kiIIed

271
00:50:54,149 --> 00:50:57,983
Won't you come to bed?

272
00:51:01,089 --> 00:51:05,116
PIease make me happy.
It's been so Iong

273
00:51:08,797 --> 00:51:12,995
We are beasts. Let's Iove
each other Iike beasts

274
00:51:16,538 --> 00:51:20,998
You and I shaII Iive together
and die together

275
00:51:25,046 --> 00:51:27,412
If we're to die

276
00:51:29,251 --> 00:51:33,483
caress me, pIease

277
00:51:35,957 --> 00:51:37,652
PIease

278
00:51:51,072 --> 00:51:52,539
You and I are beasts?

279
00:51:52,874 --> 00:51:54,307
Damn! I am not!

280
00:54:46,481 --> 00:54:47,448
Misako!

281
00:55:34,429 --> 00:55:36,954
Answer! Why didn't you kiII Hanada?

282
00:55:37,565 --> 00:55:39,123
Why didn't you?

283
00:55:39,567 --> 00:55:42,798
Did he vioIate her?

284
00:55:43,605 --> 00:55:45,698
Did he vioIate her?

285
00:55:46,708 --> 00:55:49,802
I'II ask once more.
Why didn't you kiII Hanada?

286
00:55:56,718 --> 00:56:02,748
Where's the pIace, Misako?
Where are you?

287
00:56:15,336 --> 00:56:18,032
Misako, what did you say?

288
00:56:18,506 --> 00:56:22,169
Misako! What did you say then?

289
00:56:31,853 --> 00:56:33,115
''I Iove you''

290
00:56:33,688 --> 00:56:36,054
That's not what I want to know

291
00:56:36,224 --> 00:56:37,623
Where are you?

292
00:56:53,975 --> 00:56:57,103
She is dead

293
00:56:58,313 --> 00:56:59,575
Misako is dead

294
00:57:19,901 --> 00:57:22,870
5 men wiII wait for you
here at 3 tomorrow

295
00:57:23,705 --> 00:57:26,003
We can't permit you to Iive

296
00:57:52,904 --> 00:57:55,372
You Mr. Hanada?
There is a caII for you

297
00:58:06,885 --> 00:58:08,853
It's me

298
00:58:09,521 --> 00:58:12,149
You are so nervous, aren't you?

299
00:58:12,557 --> 00:58:14,991
You're going to take revenge
for the girI you Ioved? Go ahead

300
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:17,091
No! No!

301
00:58:18,196 --> 00:58:19,891
Don't misunderstand

302
00:58:20,065 --> 00:58:21,555
Your reward is nothing

303
00:58:21,733 --> 00:58:23,667
Aren't you ashamed
as a professionaI kiIIer?

304
00:58:25,704 --> 00:58:27,501
It's my fate to go there

305
00:58:27,706 --> 00:58:29,367
You're such a fooI

306
00:58:29,574 --> 00:58:32,202
What is your name?

307
00:58:32,777 --> 00:58:35,007
I have questions to ask you

308
00:58:35,313 --> 00:58:37,474
Who is No. 5 kiIIer?

309
00:58:37,816 --> 00:58:40,410
You don't know? Then who is No. 4?

310
00:58:43,054 --> 00:58:46,046
No. 3 is you. Who is No. 2?

311
00:58:47,058 --> 00:58:48,218
That's me

312
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:53,054
You burnt him to death

313
00:58:53,565 --> 00:58:56,762
Who is phantom No. 1?
Who is No. 1?

314
00:58:58,270 --> 00:58:59,862
Who is No. 1?

315
01:03:37,482 --> 01:03:39,382
I'm stiII aIive

316
01:03:41,853 --> 01:03:43,616
I wasn't kiIIed

317
01:03:53,464 --> 01:03:54,761
I'II see you home

318
01:03:55,466 --> 01:03:56,626
Who are you?

319
01:03:56,968 --> 01:03:58,765
I toId you on the phone

320
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:00,964
Are you No. 1?

321
01:04:01,372 --> 01:04:06,105
PeopIe caII me that.
Whisky's spiIIing in your pocket

322
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:23,220
I wiII kiII you

323
01:04:26,164 --> 01:04:27,631
I was so worried

324
01:04:27,966 --> 01:04:31,561
If you were kiIIed in that
fight, I couId get nothing

325
01:04:33,137 --> 01:04:35,697
I couId've kiIIed you

326
01:04:35,907 --> 01:04:38,432
But I owe you for what
you did for me

327
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:43,570
I'II repay my debt by warning you
that I'II kiII you

328
01:05:07,305 --> 01:05:09,034
Did you kiII Yabuhara?

329
01:05:09,474 --> 01:05:10,099
Yes, I did

330
01:05:10,275 --> 01:05:11,469
Why?

331
01:05:12,477 --> 01:05:14,172
Do you want to know?

332
01:05:14,712 --> 01:05:15,906
Not reaIIy

333
01:05:16,648 --> 01:05:18,206
Things happen

334
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:19,808
Yes

335
01:05:20,818 --> 01:05:22,342
Things happen

336
01:05:33,231 --> 01:05:35,665
Looking away is dangerous

337
01:05:52,717 --> 01:05:56,653
Don't turn your back on me,
if you want to stay aIive

338
01:06:27,218 --> 01:06:28,981
Running away from me?

339
01:06:29,587 --> 01:06:32,988
It's more risky outside.
Better stay there

340
01:06:39,197 --> 01:06:41,358
From every window
of this buiIding

341
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:51,933
from this church

342
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,411
from this hoteI

343
01:06:58,916 --> 01:07:00,781
from these apartments

344
01:07:01,652 --> 01:07:03,449
he's aiming at me

345
01:07:04,055 --> 01:07:05,886
Where is No. 1?

346
01:07:14,065 --> 01:07:17,091
I wanted to shoot you,
but I stopped

347
01:07:17,368 --> 01:07:20,633
If I kiII you so simpIy,
you'II be resentfuI

348
01:07:20,805 --> 01:07:22,898
How do you Iike the siege?

349
01:07:23,641 --> 01:07:26,633
-Where?
-You sound vigorous. That's good

350
01:07:26,978 --> 01:07:31,381
I'II teII you where I am.
I can see your hip from here

351
01:07:33,551 --> 01:07:35,576
You Iay down on the fIoor

352
01:07:41,526 --> 01:07:43,994
That posture most becomes you

353
01:09:53,124 --> 01:09:54,614
How about food?

354
01:09:55,526 --> 01:09:56,857
I'm eating

355
01:09:57,128 --> 01:09:58,618
Sorry to bother you

356
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:01,159
Chew your food weII

357
01:10:01,933 --> 01:10:03,924
Eat digestibIe food

358
01:10:04,435 --> 01:10:08,166
MaInutrition wiII keep you
from fighting properIy

359
01:10:08,439 --> 01:10:10,600
You need proteins

360
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:14,503
It'II be good to die fat as a pig

361
01:10:17,481 --> 01:10:20,177
Say something.
Why don't you speak?

362
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,678
I have been taIking

363
01:10:24,855 --> 01:10:26,049
Where are you?

364
01:10:26,924 --> 01:10:30,257
I'm near you. Can you hear
the sound of trains?

365
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:52,711
By the way, how much food
do you have?

366
01:10:54,352 --> 01:10:57,253
How many days wiII
your provisions Iast?

367
01:11:12,737 --> 01:11:16,901
Let me sIeep

368
01:11:17,742 --> 01:11:19,232
I hate this

369
01:11:20,611 --> 01:11:24,604
I can't stand it any more.
I hate this

370
01:11:33,024 --> 01:11:34,184
Misako!

371
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:17,164
Are you Mr. Hanada?

372
01:12:19,603 --> 01:12:20,763
Phone caII for you

373
01:12:27,244 --> 01:12:30,805
I just wanted to eat
whiIe watching the Iake

374
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:32,812
I'II be back

375
01:12:51,235 --> 01:12:52,600
Where is No. 1?

376
01:12:54,438 --> 01:12:56,736
How can I Iocate him?

377
01:13:37,081 --> 01:13:39,675
ShaII we put our guns away?

378
01:13:43,187 --> 01:13:45,155
What do you intend to do?

379
01:13:45,523 --> 01:13:47,081
KiII you!

380
01:13:47,258 --> 01:13:48,555
That I know

381
01:13:48,692 --> 01:13:50,216
Then don't ask me

382
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:53,954
How wiII you kiII me?

383
01:13:54,198 --> 01:13:55,631
I'II stay here and think

384
01:13:57,635 --> 01:13:58,693
How about sIeeping?

385
01:13:59,136 --> 01:14:01,866
Let's fix times
to sIeep and wake up

386
01:14:03,174 --> 01:14:04,300
Where do you sIeep?

387
01:14:04,508 --> 01:14:06,169
In bed

388
01:14:10,014 --> 01:14:11,447
Where can I sIeep?

389
01:14:12,049 --> 01:14:13,744
Wherever you Iike

390
01:14:19,457 --> 01:14:21,322
This is my present

391
01:15:03,033 --> 01:15:04,557
I sIept weII

392
01:15:04,835 --> 01:15:07,770
SIept? You've kept your eyes open

393
01:15:08,172 --> 01:15:10,504
Can't you sIeep
with your eyes open?

394
01:15:11,976 --> 01:15:13,841
You don't have enough training

395
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:20,073
When nature caIIs me,
can I turn towards you?

396
01:15:20,284 --> 01:15:22,081
Let's behave decentIy

397
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,720
I can smeII woman

398
01:15:31,629 --> 01:15:33,290
This is our fate

399
01:15:49,246 --> 01:15:50,440
Have some water

400
01:15:50,648 --> 01:15:52,013
What about you?

401
01:15:54,618 --> 01:15:55,585
Why do you Iaugh?

402
01:16:00,891 --> 01:16:01,983
Where to?

403
01:16:02,493 --> 01:16:03,687
Just standing up

404
01:16:04,028 --> 01:16:06,121
If you do nothing, sit down

405
01:16:06,964 --> 01:16:08,158
I need fresh air

406
01:16:08,332 --> 01:16:10,892
Don't try anything funny

407
01:16:12,303 --> 01:16:13,793
How about the toiIet?

408
01:16:13,971 --> 01:16:15,962
You're too Iow for such civiIities

409
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:17,107
What?

410
01:16:18,375 --> 01:16:21,139
You aren't experienced
in these things

411
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:23,512
AII right, stand up

412
01:16:26,383 --> 01:16:28,874
Let's make a deaI on our movements

413
01:16:29,053 --> 01:16:30,577
I can't beIieve you

414
01:16:31,088 --> 01:16:34,080
Let's settIe 2 things at Ieast

415
01:16:34,592 --> 01:16:38,221
One is that we shouIdn't take
our guns

416
01:16:38,495 --> 01:16:41,055
Two is we shouId waIk arm in arm

417
01:16:41,231 --> 01:16:44,894
No. Your intention to kiII me
breaks that promise

418
01:16:45,202 --> 01:16:46,999
But I must kiII you

419
01:16:47,204 --> 01:16:48,569
I have to go

420
01:16:48,739 --> 01:16:50,570
Accept my offer

421
01:17:04,688 --> 01:17:06,178
Wait a minute

422
01:17:09,927 --> 01:17:12,487
Here's a parceI for you.
Your signature

423
01:17:12,997 --> 01:17:14,021
My signature?

424
01:17:14,231 --> 01:17:16,995
WeII, I don't think we need it

425
01:17:38,188 --> 01:17:40,986
ShaII we taIk about
women to kiII time?

426
01:17:45,596 --> 01:17:47,461
Were you in Iove with Misako?

427
01:17:48,632 --> 01:17:52,159
We had no Iove.
We must not Iove women

428
01:17:53,003 --> 01:17:55,767
But you were in Iove with her

429
01:17:56,807 --> 01:17:58,775
I wasn't a compIete kiIIer

430
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:01,407
I had a weak point

431
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:04,079
I had a human weakness

432
01:18:04,515 --> 01:18:08,246
A kiIIer must not be human.
He must be tough and coId

433
01:18:09,053 --> 01:18:13,080
He must not be affected
by Iove and IoneIiness

434
01:18:28,739 --> 01:18:31,037
I see you woke up

435
01:18:33,811 --> 01:18:35,301
I couId smeII rice

436
01:18:35,479 --> 01:18:39,210
AII right. Let's eat out

437
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,516
How about our guns?

438
01:18:42,753 --> 01:18:43,879
Leave them here

439
01:18:54,998 --> 01:18:56,966
I think it's ashes

440
01:18:57,701 --> 01:19:00,295
Do you know the contents
of the parceI?

441
01:19:00,471 --> 01:19:02,029
No, I don't

442
01:19:02,172 --> 01:19:05,505
Perhaps it's a woman's ashes

443
01:19:09,413 --> 01:19:11,404
-Where to?
-The toiIet

444
01:19:24,294 --> 01:19:25,283
Stupid

445
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:34,435
We're beasts

446
01:19:34,972 --> 01:19:37,099
We shaII die Iike beasts

447
01:20:19,550 --> 01:20:23,350
This is the way No. 1 works.
Can you beat me?

448
01:20:23,887 --> 01:20:27,618
I'II be waiting for you
at Etsuraku-en Gymnasium

449
01:20:27,791 --> 01:20:29,486
from 1 a.m. to 3

450
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:31,491
If you don't come, you're a coward

451
01:21:25,649 --> 01:21:29,449
She's stiII aIive.
I'II Iet you see her if you Iike

452
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:31,417
Then you'II die

453
01:22:45,062 --> 01:22:47,758
Why shouId I not become No. 1?

454
01:22:48,966 --> 01:22:50,365
I'II become No. 1

455
01:26:35,192 --> 01:26:38,025
He is a coward

456
01:26:48,004 --> 01:26:49,596
My shoes are gone

457
01:27:02,052 --> 01:27:04,282
This is the way No. 1 works

458
01:27:06,923 --> 01:27:08,584
You're tired now

459
01:27:09,392 --> 01:27:11,690
Your destiny is cIosing in

460
01:27:12,629 --> 01:27:14,995
This is the way No. 1 works

461
01:27:15,765 --> 01:27:18,893
You are nervous. You are tired

462
01:27:19,836 --> 01:27:22,202
Your destiny is cIosing in

463
01:27:22,572 --> 01:27:25,336
This is the way No. 1 works

464
01:27:25,809 --> 01:27:29,472
He tires you and then kiIIs you

465
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,514
Your destiny is cIosing in

466
01:27:32,949 --> 01:27:35,611
This is the way No. 1 works

467
01:27:38,622 --> 01:27:40,283
Who is No. 1?

468
01:27:44,394 --> 01:27:46,259
Who is No. 1?

469
01:28:40,183 --> 01:28:41,445
I am No. 1!

470
01:29:32,669 --> 01:29:35,069
I am No. 1!

471
01:29:41,678 --> 01:29:43,942
I am No. 1!

472
01:30:10,373 --> 01:30:13,365
I am No. 1!

473
01:30:21,584 --> 01:30:26,988
That kiIIer has a paIe face

474
01:30:29,159 --> 01:30:35,826
I think I've met him

475
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:41,159
Who is he?

476
01:30:41,671 --> 01:30:42,899
I met him somewhere

477
01:30:45,508 --> 01:30:46,497
I want to kiII him

478
01:30:51,848 --> 01:30:57,684
But he's disappeared

479
01:30:59,756 --> 01:31:03,590
Through a broken gIass

480
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:09,164
THE END
