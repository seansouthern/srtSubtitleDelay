Who is the Iady?

00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:54,914
My wife

16
00:02:01,065 --> 00:02:02,225
I need your heIp

17
00:02:05,436 --> 00:02:06,801
They threw me out

18
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:10,103
I want to go back to that job

19
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:15,511
A man made a good offer,
but he said I'd need heIp

20
00:02:17,014 --> 00:02:18,174
Hanada

21
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:21,582
WiII you heIp me?

22
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:24,546
AII right

23
00:02:25,256 --> 00:02:27,087
I've used up my money

24
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:38,433
BoiI rice!

25
00:02:39,737 --> 00:02:41,136
He wants rice

26
00:02:42,373 --> 00:02:43,567
CertainIy

27
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:45,436
Give me a doubIe Scotch

28
00:03:03,928 --> 00:03:06,123
I feIt Ionesome

29
00:03:06,797 --> 00:03:10,028
''Don't drink! Don't touch women!''

30
00:03:10,868 --> 00:03:13,302
''Drink and women kiII a kiIIer''

31
00:03:20,144 --> 00:03:23,978
I'm to escort this man
to Nagano from Sagami Beach

32
00:03:24,148 --> 00:03:25,445
for 5 miIIion?

33
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,813
He's a big shot of
a certain organization

34
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:31,082
It's not a bad job

35
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:32,654
If nothing happens!

36
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,752
I hope not. Do you want to try?

37
00:03:40,731 --> 00:03:41,857
Here's 2,500,000 yen

38
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:45,258
He'II pay the baIance
when you get him there

39
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,299
You are No. 3 kiIIer.
I'II reIy on your skiII

40
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:53,475
You'II find a car at Shinagawa

41
00:03:54,512 --> 00:03:56,070
The key's behind the bumper

42
00:03:58,316 --> 00:04:00,910
CaII me here at Ieast once

43
00:04:31,682 --> 00:04:32,740
What happened, sir?

44
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:41,055
He has a pecuIiar quirk.
I hate it

45
00:04:42,827 --> 00:04:47,560
He Iikes the smeII of boiIing
rice better than anything eIse

46
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,634
I can't heIp smeIIing this scent

47
00:04:56,574 --> 00:05:01,568
PIease don't. My husband
is a dreadfuI man

48
00:05:23,868 --> 00:05:24,892
What's up?

49
00:05:26,404 --> 00:05:27,666
Look in back

50
00:05:34,578 --> 00:05:36,045
ProbabIy the driver

51
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:38,570
What to do?

52
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:39,841
Dump him Iater

53
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:51,159
-The man who shot him is skiIIfuI.
-Can you teII?

54
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:54,722
-I was one of the 10 best.
-Who did it?

55
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,828
No. 2 kiIIer, Sakura,
or No. 4, Koh

56
00:05:58,736 --> 00:06:00,829
Or perhaps the phantom No. 1

57
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:05,399
He doesn't exist

58
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,337
They onIy taIk about him.
Nobody has seen him

59
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:11,212
But he exists

60
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:23,188
Phantom No. 1

61
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:28,590
Once I wanted that top ranking

62
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:50,906
It seems you're accustomed to
risky situations, so I'II teII you

63
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:55,182
A corpse was exactIy
where you are now

64
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:07,895
PIease do as we teII you.
Don't make any sudden moves

65
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:40,690
You know what to do

66
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:10,523
Hey, you!

67
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:17,728
My hand trembIed at that moment.
I can't heIp drinking

68
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:19,502
Aren't you a pro?

69
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:53,770
HeIIo, this is Yabuhara

70
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:59,770
Is this 369-5551?
I'm supposed to caII you

71
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:06,207
This is Yabuhara

72
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,381
Nothing has happened so far

73
00:10:10,554 --> 00:10:13,785
Good. Then nothing wiII happen

74
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:30,507
Once I was ranked

75
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:34,142
Hanada, don't you know?

76
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:46,149
I'm sorry

77
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,948
I can do my job

78
00:11:18,222 --> 00:11:20,349
Hey, wake up! Wake up!

79
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:26,462
Stop it!

80
00:11:26,764 --> 00:11:28,129
HoId on tight!

81
00:11:50,354 --> 00:11:51,412
My cIient

82
00:12:06,737 --> 00:12:08,728
FooI! Protect our guest!

83
00:12:56,753 --> 00:12:57,879
Hanada!

84
00:13:07,264 --> 00:13:08,424
Hanada!

85
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:40,227
Kasuga

86
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:44,331
He isn't drunk Iike you!

87
00:13:47,738 --> 00:13:49,535
I don't want to miss

88
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:51,165
Stop!

89
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:55,944
Koh!

90
00:13:57,381 --> 00:13:58,575
It's me!

91
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:00,683
This is Kasuga!

92
00:14:52,302 --> 00:14:54,964
A pro doesn't do things that way

93
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,073
A strong man
wiII be waiting for us

94
00:15:00,811 --> 00:15:03,211
His paI's named Sakura

95
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:06,438
Where are you going?

96
00:15:06,617 --> 00:15:07,675
I'II get their car

97
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:23,697
I see you're safe

98
00:15:25,035 --> 00:15:26,662
Why did you fire?

99
00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:02,460
What shaII we do?

100
00:16:05,242 --> 00:16:06,834
Let's go ahead

101
00:16:07,377 --> 00:16:10,471
Perhaps they'II think
Koh is coming back

102
00:17:33,296 --> 00:17:35,890
Sakura, you are the Ioser!

103
00:17:36,066 --> 00:17:38,694
Hanada? I haven't
been waiting for you

104
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:40,696
You've been demoted

105
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:41,860
What?

106
00:17:42,072 --> 00:17:43,061
Come out and see!

107
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:34,017
What's your rank?

108
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:36,515
What's your rank?

109
00:20:03,813 --> 00:20:05,007
Are you married?

110
00:20:08,552 --> 00:20:09,678
I hate men

111
00:20:11,187 --> 00:20:12,677
Then you have no hope

112
00:20:19,829 --> 00:20:21,660
My hope is to die

113
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:40,168
You're crazy!

114
00:21:42,212 --> 00:21:43,201
You bitch!

115
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:51,917
HoId me tight

116
00:22:30,493 --> 00:22:32,620
Horny!

117
00:22:33,396 --> 00:22:34,624
HeIp me!

118
00:22:51,715 --> 00:22:52,909
Cook rice

119
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,583
No, I won't

120
00:22:56,286 --> 00:22:58,186
I said cook rice!

121
00:23:01,257 --> 00:23:05,523
DarIing

122
00:23:14,104 --> 00:23:16,334
Stop it. You're abnormaI!

123
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:34,179
DarIing, won't you
come shopping with me?

124
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,854
Why so mean? You're onIy kind
to me when you're with me in bed

125
00:24:51,434 --> 00:24:55,370
There are 4 birds.
The same amount and the same way

126
00:24:55,872 --> 00:24:56,861
AII right

127
00:24:57,073 --> 00:24:58,870
The sooner the better

128
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:00,031
It'II be done

129
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,268
Are you sure?

130
00:25:01,444 --> 00:25:03,503
If you're worried, hire others

131
00:25:03,947 --> 00:25:06,882
The photographs are
in your maiIbox by now

132
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,608
My regards to your wife

133
00:26:28,531 --> 00:26:31,466
Dr. Hino, Optometrist

134
00:26:56,859 --> 00:26:58,417
You do this so often

135
00:26:59,062 --> 00:27:00,290
-Be patient.
-Ouch!

136
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:02,486
That hurts

137
00:28:02,492 --> 00:28:04,517
Why don't you get him quickIy?

138
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:06,260
I need time

139
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:07,794
You must hurry

140
00:28:08,898 --> 00:28:10,126
I'II do it soon

141
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:21,976
Who are you?

142
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:18,392
FooI! Don't be so extravagant!

143
00:29:19,802 --> 00:29:20,826
Take it back!

144
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:35,212
Who's she? You've been spending
money on women, haven't you?

145
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:36,610
You sex maniac!

146
00:29:39,422 --> 00:29:40,946
Crazy

147
00:29:55,905 --> 00:29:56,997
Who sent you?

148
00:29:58,174 --> 00:29:59,835
Your wife suits you

149
00:30:00,343 --> 00:30:01,640
What do you want?

150
00:30:02,311 --> 00:30:04,211
KiII a foreigner

151
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,071
I rented a room you can
sight in on him from

152
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,346
He usuaIIy takes
a woman's Ieft arm

153
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,312
You'II see us waIking together
for onIy 3 seconds

154
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,752
What do you mean?

155
00:30:16,025 --> 00:30:17,583
You'II have 3 seconds

156
00:30:17,793 --> 00:30:21,786
-I refuse.
-No, you can't. You heard the pIan

157
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:23,259
Who's behind you?

158
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:28,027
I, Misako, am your customer.
The fee is 1,500,000 yen

159
00:30:28,204 --> 00:30:29,193
3 seconds?

160
00:30:29,772 --> 00:30:31,672
I'II step aside a IittIe

161
00:30:32,108 --> 00:30:35,407
For a spIit second you'II
be abIe to see his chest

162
00:30:35,811 --> 00:30:36,971
It's a deviI's job

163
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,148
I heard you were a deviI

164
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:43,613
Maybe I can.
But a pro prefers a safer way

165
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,112
-Isn't there any other way?
-There's none

166
00:30:47,523 --> 00:30:49,013
You may be hit

167
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:54,889
You're beautifuI

168
00:32:03,466 --> 00:32:05,161
A speciaI news report

169
00:32:05,635 --> 00:32:08,229
At about 11 o'cIock this morning

170
00:32:08,404 --> 00:32:12,738
somebody shot a woman and
a foreigner near the Asahi BuiIding

171
00:32:13,376 --> 00:32:15,173
The woman died instantIy

172
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:18,744
The foreigner was seriousIy
injured, but he wiII Iive

173
00:32:19,548 --> 00:32:23,450
One of the two criminaIs
seems to be a woman

174
00:32:25,221 --> 00:32:26,711
You know, don't you?

175
00:32:26,889 --> 00:32:27,947
I know

176
00:32:28,624 --> 00:32:32,617
A featherIike thing settIed
on the barreI. That's aII

177
00:32:32,862 --> 00:32:34,022
You're wrong

178
00:32:36,165 --> 00:32:37,097
I'm right

179
00:32:37,466 --> 00:32:39,559
I don't mean that

180
00:32:40,236 --> 00:32:42,796
You kiIIed a stranger

181
00:32:43,372 --> 00:32:47,001
You made a bad mistake.
You're finished

182
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:51,904
Your ranking's gone.
And you'II be kiIIed by someone

183
00:32:53,449 --> 00:32:54,973
I know that

184
00:32:55,518 --> 00:32:57,645
We're to kiII or be kiIIed

185
00:32:58,521 --> 00:32:59,988
You're going to die

186
00:33:01,657 --> 00:33:02,783
Die?

187
00:33:05,161 --> 00:33:08,028
Have you ever thought of death?

188
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:12,891
Goodbye

189
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:50,870
You're Iate

190
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:11,349
I knew this was the onIy
pIace you wouId come to

191
00:34:12,428 --> 00:34:14,089
You are mine

192
00:34:23,873 --> 00:34:25,363
We are beasts

193
00:34:28,711 --> 00:34:30,178
We are beasts

194
00:34:34,183 --> 00:34:36,344
Beast needs beast

195
00:34:37,186 --> 00:34:39,780
That's the best way

196
00:34:40,222 --> 00:34:43,055
You and I are beasts

197
00:34:52,268 --> 00:34:53,496
Who you caIIing?

198
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:56,468
An airIine company

199
00:34:57,373 --> 00:34:59,864
I'II Ieave Japan
'tiII things cooI off

200
00:35:03,913 --> 00:35:04,675
Mami!

201
00:36:24,593 --> 00:36:27,824
Misako, I haven't died

202
00:36:59,795 --> 00:37:01,456
Stop or I'II shoot you

203
00:37:03,432 --> 00:37:05,297
I want to wash the bIood off

204
00:37:14,543 --> 00:37:15,669
You're beautifuI

205
00:37:17,146 --> 00:37:18,272
Remove your cIothes

206
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:27,382
This can kiII a man

207
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:32,021
Is it poisoned? It Iooks Iike
just a sewing machine needIe

208
00:37:38,033 --> 00:37:39,261
I am hungry

209
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,603
I want to eat rice

210
00:37:43,505 --> 00:37:45,530
-Why?
-Rice!

211
00:37:45,975 --> 00:37:49,376
I'm taIking about hot boiIed rice.
I want rice!

212
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:22,174
It's Iike a grave

213
00:38:24,413 --> 00:38:26,210
Where can I pin you?

214
00:38:30,285 --> 00:38:32,082
I've wanted to embrace you

215
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:34,887
When I think I have the chance

216
00:38:35,724 --> 00:38:38,750
you're trying to kiII me.
What an irony!

217
00:38:43,532 --> 00:38:46,899
Where's your gun?
You must have one

218
00:38:47,302 --> 00:38:48,929
I Iove you

219
00:38:50,506 --> 00:38:52,701
Damn you! Don't despise me!

220
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:55,374
I can kiII you with one shot

221
00:38:57,413 --> 00:39:00,712
You won't, untiI you sIeep with me

222
00:39:04,353 --> 00:39:08,653
Where is the rice?
Do you have some rice?

223
00:39:08,957 --> 00:39:10,424
If you don't, buy some

224
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:13,527
You can buy it at a rice deaIer's

225
00:39:20,469 --> 00:39:22,903
Go and buy some rice for me

226
00:39:41,523 --> 00:39:44,458
Misako, you must not underrate me

227
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:03,010
Are you sure?
Are you on the IeveI?

228
00:41:38,674 --> 00:41:39,902
Where's the needIe?

229
00:42:02,297 --> 00:42:05,630
I'II kiII you.
That's what you have hoped for

230
00:43:14,136 --> 00:43:16,036
What are they? What are they?

231
00:43:19,074 --> 00:43:22,566
I have this. I don't want
to be invoIved in this

232
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,190
You've changed

233
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:49,929
Even if you change, I can't change

234
00:43:58,013 --> 00:43:59,139
Misako

235
00:43:59,748 --> 00:44:01,409
I can't die Iike this

236
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:37,651
I've decided not to kiII you.
I'm going

237
00:44:47,029 --> 00:44:50,590
Stop! If you puII the trigger,
it wiII backfire

238
00:44:50,832 --> 00:44:52,459
The barreI's cIogged

239
00:44:54,102 --> 00:44:57,230
I don't care. I'm aIready a corpse

240
00:45:00,475 --> 00:45:01,339
You're a fooI!

241
00:45:24,966 --> 00:45:26,661
Goodbye forever

242
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:30,704
I couIdn't kiII her. I couIdn't

243
00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:36,202
She tried to kiII me

244
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,407
Am I a pro kiIIer?

245
00:45:40,816 --> 00:45:44,650
I am no good as a kiIIer.
At any rate I must

246
00:47:14,976 --> 00:47:17,137
This is Yabuhara

247
00:47:17,412 --> 00:47:21,906
Is it you, darIing? Where are you?
Don't make me fret

248
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:23,072
HeIIo, heIIo!

249
00:48:01,523 --> 00:48:03,081
You're Iate

250
00:48:03,792 --> 00:48:05,919
I feIt Ionesome, darIing

251
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:40,485
Are you going to kiII me?

252
00:48:41,029 --> 00:48:42,656
Did you come here to kiII me?

253
00:48:43,832 --> 00:48:45,800
Are you going to kiII me?

254
00:48:49,904 --> 00:48:51,633
You're not, are you?

255
00:48:54,643 --> 00:48:56,474
You're just pretending

256
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:12,816
You know I was ordered
to kiII you, don't you?

257
00:49:13,928 --> 00:49:15,520
You know that

258
00:49:16,965 --> 00:49:18,489
I know everything

259
00:49:19,401 --> 00:49:21,198
I know why they were kiIIed

260
00:49:22,037 --> 00:49:24,301
I heard everything from Yabuhara

261
00:49:26,241 --> 00:49:28,641
I'II teII you,
but you can do nothing

262
00:49:49,731 --> 00:49:53,326
Something happened
in smuggIing diamonds

263
00:49:54,202 --> 00:49:58,298
The quantity we received
was Iess than what they sent

264
00:49:59,107 --> 00:50:00,938
A customs man stoIe some

265
00:50:01,176 --> 00:50:03,041
a deaIer cut them

266
00:50:03,211 --> 00:50:05,008
and an optometrist soId them

267
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:10,080
If the sender found out,
he wouId stop suppIying stones

268
00:50:10,919 --> 00:50:16,289
So we asked you to kiII
the foreign investigator

269
00:50:18,526 --> 00:50:20,391
but you faiIed

270
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:25,662
If the organization finds out
I toId you this, I'II be kiIIed

271
00:50:41,149 --> 00:50:44,983
Won't you come to bed?

272
00:50:48,089 --> 00:50:52,116
PIease make me happy.
It's been so Iong

273
00:50:55,797 --> 00:50:59,995
We are beasts. Let's Iove
each other Iike beasts

274
00:51:03,538 --> 00:51:07,998
You and I shaII Iive together
and die together

275
00:51:12,046 --> 00:51:14,412
If we're to die

276
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:20,483
caress me, pIease

277
00:51:22,957 --> 00:51:24,652
PIease

278
00:51:38,072 --> 00:51:39,539
You and I are beasts?

279
00:51:39,874 --> 00:51:41,307
Damn! I am not!

280
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:34,448
Misako!

281
00:55:21,429 --> 00:55:23,954
Answer! Why didn't you kiII Hanada?

282
00:55:24,565 --> 00:55:26,123
Why didn't you?

283
00:55:26,567 --> 00:55:29,798
Did he vioIate her?

284
00:55:30,605 --> 00:55:32,698
Did he vioIate her?

285
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:36,802
I'II ask once more.
Why didn't you kiII Hanada?

286
00:55:43,718 --> 00:55:49,748
Where's the pIace, Misako?
Where are you?

287
00:56:02,336 --> 00:56:05,032
Misako, what did you say?

288
00:56:05,506 --> 00:56:09,169
Misako! What did you say then?

289
00:56:18,853 --> 00:56:20,115
''I Iove you''

290
00:56:20,688 --> 00:56:23,054
That's not what I want to know

291
00:56:23,224 --> 00:56:24,623
Where are you?

292
00:56:40,975 --> 00:56:44,103
She is dead

293
00:56:45,313 --> 00:56:46,575
Misako is dead

294
00:57:06,901 --> 00:57:09,870
5 men wiII wait for you
here at 3 tomorrow

295
00:57:10,705 --> 00:57:13,003
We can't permit you to Iive

296
00:57:39,904 --> 00:57:42,372
You Mr. Hanada?
There is a caII for you

297
00:57:53,885 --> 00:57:55,853
It's me

298
00:57:56,521 --> 00:57:59,149
You are so nervous, aren't you?

299
00:57:59,557 --> 00:58:01,991
You're going to take revenge
for the girI you Ioved? Go ahead

300
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,091
No! No!

301
00:58:05,196 --> 00:58:06,891
Don't misunderstand

302
00:58:07,065 --> 00:58:08,555
Your reward is nothing

303
00:58:08,733 --> 00:58:10,667
Aren't you ashamed
as a professionaI kiIIer?

304
00:58:12,704 --> 00:58:14,501
It's my fate to go there

305
00:58:14,706 --> 00:58:16,367
You're such a fooI

306
00:58:16,574 --> 00:58:19,202
What is your name?

307
00:58:19,777 --> 00:58:22,007
I have questions to ask you

308
00:58:22,313 --> 00:58:24,474
Who is No. 5 kiIIer?

309
00:58:24,816 --> 00:58:27,410
You don't know? Then who is No. 4?

310
00:58:30,054 --> 00:58:33,046
No. 3 is you. Who is No. 2?

311
00:58:34,058 --> 00:58:35,218
That's me

312
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:40,054
You burnt him to death

313
00:58:40,565 --> 00:58:43,762
Who is phantom No. 1?
Who is No. 1?

314
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:46,862
Who is No. 1?

315
01:03:24,482 --> 01:03:26,382
I'm stiII aIive

316
01:03:28,853 --> 01:03:30,616
I wasn't kiIIed

317
01:03:40,464 --> 01:03:41,761
I'II see you home

318
01:03:42,466 --> 01:03:43,626
Who are you?

319
01:03:43,968 --> 01:03:45,765
I toId you on the phone

320
01:03:46,838 --> 01:03:47,964
Are you No. 1?

321
01:03:48,372 --> 01:03:53,105
PeopIe caII me that.
Whisky's spiIIing in your pocket

322
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,220
I wiII kiII you

323
01:04:13,164 --> 01:04:14,631
I was so worried

324
01:04:14,966 --> 01:04:18,561
If you were kiIIed in that
fight, I couId get nothing

325
01:04:20,137 --> 01:04:22,697
I couId've kiIIed you

326
01:04:22,907 --> 01:04:25,432
But I owe you for what
you did for me

327
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:30,570
I'II repay my debt by warning you
that I'II kiII you

328
01:04:54,305 --> 01:04:56,034
Did you kiII Yabuhara?

329
01:04:56,474 --> 01:04:57,099
Yes, I did

330
01:04:57,275 --> 01:04:58,469
Why?

331
01:04:59,477 --> 01:05:01,172
Do you want to know?

332
01:05:01,712 --> 01:05:02,906
Not reaIIy

333
01:05:03,648 --> 01:05:05,206
Things happen

334
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:06,808
Yes

335
01:05:07,818 --> 01:05:09,342
Things happen

336
01:05:20,231 --> 01:05:22,665
Looking away is dangerous

337
01:05:39,717 --> 01:05:43,653
Don't turn your back on me,
if you want to stay aIive

338
01:06:14,218 --> 01:06:15,981
Running away from me?

339
01:06:16,587 --> 01:06:19,988
It's more risky outside.
Better stay there

340
01:06:26,197 --> 01:06:28,358
From every window
of this buiIding

341
01:06:37,375 --> 01:06:38,933
from this church

342
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,411
from this hoteI

343
01:06:45,916 --> 01:06:47,781
from these apartments

344
01:06:48,652 --> 01:06:50,449
he's aiming at me

345
01:06:51,055 --> 01:06:52,886
Where is No. 1?

346
01:07:01,065 --> 01:07:04,091
I wanted to shoot you,
but I stopped

347
01:07:04,368 --> 01:07:07,633
If I kiII you so simpIy,
you'II be resentfuI

348
01:07:07,805 --> 01:07:09,898
How do you Iike the siege?

349
01:07:10,641 --> 01:07:13,633
-Where?
-You sound vigorous. That's good

350
01:07:13,978 --> 01:07:18,381
I'II teII you where I am.
I can see your hip from here

351
01:07:20,551 --> 01:07:22,576
You Iay down on the fIoor

352
01:07:28,526 --> 01:07:30,994
That posture most becomes you

353
01:09:40,124 --> 01:09:41,614
How about food?

354
01:09:42,526 --> 01:09:43,857
I'm eating

355
01:09:44,128 --> 01:09:45,618
Sorry to bother you

356
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:48,159
Chew your food weII

357
01:09:48,933 --> 01:09:50,924
Eat digestibIe food

358
01:09:51,435 --> 01:09:55,166
MaInutrition wiII keep you
from fighting properIy

359
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:57,600
You need proteins

360
01:09:58,375 --> 01:10:01,503
It'II be good to die fat as a pig

361
01:10:04,481 --> 01:10:07,177
Say something.
Why don't you speak?

362
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,678
I have been taIking

363
01:10:11,855 --> 01:10:13,049
Where are you?

364
01:10:13,924 --> 01:10:17,257
I'm near you. Can you hear
the sound of trains?

365
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,711
By the way, how much food
do you have?

366
01:10:41,352 --> 01:10:44,253
How many days wiII
your provisions Iast?

367
01:10:59,737 --> 01:11:03,901
Let me sIeep

368
01:11:04,742 --> 01:11:06,232
I hate this

369
01:11:07,611 --> 01:11:11,604
I can't stand it any more.
I hate this

370
01:11:20,024 --> 01:11:21,184
Misako!

371
01:12:02,833 --> 01:12:04,164
Are you Mr. Hanada?

372
01:12:06,603 --> 01:12:07,763
Phone caII for you

373
01:12:14,244 --> 01:12:17,805
I just wanted to eat
whiIe watching the Iake

374
01:12:18,515 --> 01:12:19,812
I'II be back

375
01:12:38,235 --> 01:12:39,600
Where is No. 1?

376
01:12:41,438 --> 01:12:43,736
How can I Iocate him?

377
01:13:24,081 --> 01:13:26,675
ShaII we put our guns away?

378
01:13:30,187 --> 01:13:32,155
What do you intend to do?

379
01:13:32,523 --> 01:13:34,081
KiII you!

380
01:13:34,258 --> 01:13:35,555
That I know

381
01:13:35,692 --> 01:13:37,216
Then don't ask me

382
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:40,954
How wiII you kiII me?

383
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:42,631
I'II stay here and think

384
01:13:44,635 --> 01:13:45,693
How about sIeeping?

385
01:13:46,136 --> 01:13:48,866
Let's fix times
to sIeep and wake up

386
01:13:50,174 --> 01:13:51,300
Where do you sIeep?

387
01:13:51,508 --> 01:13:53,169
In bed

388
01:13:57,014 --> 01:13:58,447
Where can I sIeep?

389
01:13:59,049 --> 01:14:00,744
Wherever you Iike

390
01:14:06,457 --> 01:14:08,322
This is my present

391
01:14:50,033 --> 01:14:51,557
I sIept weII

392
01:14:51,835 --> 01:14:54,770
SIept? You've kept your eyes open

393
01:14:55,172 --> 01:14:57,504
Can't you sIeep
with your eyes open?

394
01:14:58,976 --> 01:15:00,841
You don't have enough training

395
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:07,073
When nature caIIs me,
can I turn towards you?

396
01:15:07,284 --> 01:15:09,081
Let's behave decentIy

397
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,720
I can smeII woman

398
01:15:18,629 --> 01:15:20,290
This is our fate

399
01:15:36,246 --> 01:15:37,440
Have some water

400
01:15:37,648 --> 01:15:39,013
What about you?

401
01:15:41,618 --> 01:15:42,585
Why do you Iaugh?

402
01:15:47,891 --> 01:15:48,983
Where to?

403
01:15:49,493 --> 01:15:50,687
Just standing up

404
01:15:51,028 --> 01:15:53,121
If you do nothing, sit down

405
01:15:53,964 --> 01:15:55,158
I need fresh air

406
01:15:55,332 --> 01:15:57,892
Don't try anything funny

407
01:15:59,303 --> 01:16:00,793
How about the toiIet?

408
01:16:00,971 --> 01:16:02,962
You're too Iow for such civiIities

409
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:04,107
What?

410
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:08,139
You aren't experienced
in these things

411
01:16:09,079 --> 01:16:10,512
AII right, stand up

412
01:16:13,383 --> 01:16:15,874
Let's make a deaI on our movements

413
01:16:16,053 --> 01:16:17,577
I can't beIieve you

414
01:16:18,088 --> 01:16:21,080
Let's settIe 2 things at Ieast

415
01:16:21,592 --> 01:16:25,221
One is that we shouIdn't take
our guns

416
01:16:25,495 --> 01:16:28,055
Two is we shouId waIk arm in arm

417
01:16:28,231 --> 01:16:31,894
No. Your intention to kiII me
breaks that promise

418
01:16:32,202 --> 01:16:33,999
But I must kiII you

419
01:16:34,204 --> 01:16:35,569
I have to go

420
01:16:35,739 --> 01:16:37,570
Accept my offer

421
01:16:51,688 --> 01:16:53,178
Wait a minute

422
01:16:56,927 --> 01:16:59,487
Here's a parceI for you.
Your signature

423
01:16:59,997 --> 01:17:01,021
My signature?

424
01:17:01,231 --> 01:17:03,995
WeII, I don't think we need it

425
01:17:25,188 --> 01:17:27,986
ShaII we taIk about
women to kiII time?

426
01:17:32,596 --> 01:17:34,461
Were you in Iove with Misako?

427
01:17:35,632 --> 01:17:39,159
We had no Iove.
We must not Iove women

428
01:17:40,003 --> 01:17:42,767
But you were in Iove with her

429
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,775
I wasn't a compIete kiIIer

430
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:48,407
I had a weak point

431
01:17:48,679 --> 01:17:51,079
I had a human weakness

432
01:17:51,515 --> 01:17:55,246
A kiIIer must not be human.
He must be tough and coId

433
01:17:56,053 --> 01:18:00,080
He must not be affected
by Iove and IoneIiness

434
01:18:15,739 --> 01:18:18,037
I see you woke up

435
01:18:20,811 --> 01:18:22,301
I couId smeII rice

436
01:18:22,479 --> 01:18:26,210
AII right. Let's eat out

437
01:18:28,151 --> 01:18:29,516
How about our guns?

438
01:18:29,753 --> 01:18:30,879
Leave them here

439
01:18:41,998 --> 01:18:43,966
I think it's ashes

440
01:18:44,701 --> 01:18:47,295
Do you know the contents
of the parceI?

441
01:18:47,471 --> 01:18:49,029
No, I don't

442
01:18:49,172 --> 01:18:52,505
Perhaps it's a woman's ashes

443
01:18:56,413 --> 01:18:58,404
-Where to?
-The toiIet

444
01:19:11,294 --> 01:19:12,283
Stupid

445
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:21,435
We're beasts

446
01:19:21,972 --> 01:19:24,099
We shaII die Iike beasts

447
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:10,350
This is the way No. 1 works.
Can you beat me?

448
01:20:10,887 --> 01:20:14,618
I'II be waiting for you
at Etsuraku-en Gymnasium

449
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:16,486
from 1 a.m. to 3

450
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:18,491
If you don't come, you're a coward

451
01:21:12,649 --> 01:21:16,449
She's stiII aIive.
I'II Iet you see her if you Iike

452
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:18,417
Then you'II die

453
01:22:32,062 --> 01:22:34,758
Why shouId I not become No. 1?

454
01:22:35,966 --> 01:22:37,365
I'II become No. 1

455
01:26:22,192 --> 01:26:25,025
He is a coward

456
01:26:35,004 --> 01:26:36,596
My shoes are gone

457
01:26:49,052 --> 01:26:51,282
This is the way No. 1 works

458
01:26:53,923 --> 01:26:55,584
You're tired now

459
01:26:56,392 --> 01:26:58,690
Your destiny is cIosing in

460
01:26:59,629 --> 01:27:01,995
This is the way No. 1 works

461
01:27:02,765 --> 01:27:05,893
You are nervous. You are tired

462
01:27:06,836 --> 01:27:09,202
Your destiny is cIosing in

463
01:27:09,572 --> 01:27:12,336
This is the way No. 1 works

464
01:27:12,809 --> 01:27:16,472
He tires you and then kiIIs you

465
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:19,514
Your destiny is cIosing in

466
01:27:19,949 --> 01:27:22,611
This is the way No. 1 works

467
01:27:25,622 --> 01:27:27,283
Who is No. 1?

468
01:27:31,394 --> 01:27:33,259
Who is No. 1?

469
01:28:27,183 --> 01:28:28,445
I am No. 1!

470
01:29:19,669 --> 01:29:22,069
I am No. 1!

471
01:29:28,678 --> 01:29:30,942
I am No. 1!

472
01:29:57,373 --> 01:30:00,365
I am No. 1!

473
01:30:08,584 --> 01:30:13,988
That kiIIer has a paIe face

474
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:22,826
I think I've met him

475
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:28,159
Who is he?

476
01:30:28,671 --> 01:30:29,899
I met him somewhere

477
01:30:32,508 --> 01:30:33,497
I want to kiII him

478
01:30:38,848 --> 01:30:44,684
But he's disappeared

479
01:30:46,756 --> 01:30:50,590
Through a broken gIass

480
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:56,164
THE END
